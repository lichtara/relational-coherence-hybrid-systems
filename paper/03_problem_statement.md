## 03. Problem Statement

The rapid integration of artificial intelligence into institutional, organizational, and societal systems has exposed a growing gap between technical system performance and systemic governability. While many hybrid human–AI systems continue to operate efficiently in terms of accuracy, speed, or optimization, they increasingly exhibit failures of accountability, legitimacy, and relational coherence. These failures do not arise primarily from technical malfunction, but from structural misalignment in how agency, responsibility, and meaning are organized across human, institutional, and algorithmic layers.

Current approaches to AI governance struggle to adequately address this gap. Dominant frameworks tend to focus either on isolated interactions between agents, on optimization and alignment of system outputs, or on the imposition of formal boundaries through rules and compliance mechanisms. Each of these approaches captures an important aspect of hybrid systems, yet none provides a sufficient structural account of how governability is sustained—or eroded—under conditions of high relational density, automation, and institutional coupling.

Models centered on interaction typically analyze human–AI relations at the level of interfaces, decision points, or feedback loops. While valuable, these approaches often presuppose a stable relational environment and thus fail to account for the degradation of shared meaning, trust, and interpretive orientation that occurs even when interactions remain frequent and technically functional. As a result, they struggle to explain systemic phenomena such as erosion of legitimacy, normalization of opaque decision-making, or breakdowns in collective sense-making.

Optimization-driven models, prevalent in AI alignment, control theory, and performance-oriented governance, frame coherence primarily as consistency, efficiency, or convergence toward predefined objectives. In the absence of an explicit structural account of limits, such models risk producing forms of coerced coherence that suppress plural judgment, obscure responsibility, and generate brittle systems. Apparent alignment at the level of outputs may mask deeper incoherence across normative, institutional, or temporal dimensions.

Regulatory and compliance-based approaches, by contrast, emphasize boundaries, constraints, and formal accountability mechanisms. Although indispensable, these approaches frequently operate without a relational understanding of the systems they seek to govern. Limits imposed without sensitivity to field dynamics and coherence processes may become symbolic, selectively enforced, or destabilizing, failing to sustain meaningful accountability or adaptive capacity.

The core problem addressed in this paper is therefore not the absence of governance mechanisms, but the lack of an integrated structural model capable of explaining how governability emerges and deteriorates in hybrid human–AI systems. Existing frameworks tend to treat field conditions, coherence processes, and limits as separable concerns, rather than as mutually constitutive elements of a single relational structure.

This fragmentation obscures early signs of systemic drift. Hybrid systems may continue to meet performance benchmarks and compliance requirements while progressively losing relational legibility, diffusing responsibility, and undermining institutional trust. Governance failures thus tend to be detected only after harm has occurred, when corrective intervention is costly, contested, or ineffective.

This paper addresses this gap by formulating the problem of AI governance as a structural problem of relational coherence. It argues that governability in hybrid human–AI systems depends on a minimal and irreducible triadic structure composed of Field, Coherence, and Limit. Without an explicit account of how these elements interact, governance efforts remain reactive, fragmented, and vulnerable to cascading failure.

By articulating this problem, the paper shifts the focus of AI governance from controlling behavior or optimizing outputs to sustaining the structural conditions under which agency, accountability, and meaning remain intelligible over time. This reframing establishes the foundation for the triadic model developed in subsequent sections and for the adaptive governance implications derived from it.
