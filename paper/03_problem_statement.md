## 03. Problem Statement

The rapid integration of artificial intelligence into institutional, organizational, and societal systems has revealed a growing gap between technical system performance and systemic governability. Many hybrid human–AI systems continue to function efficiently—producing accurate outputs, optimizing processes, and scaling decisions—while simultaneously becoming harder to understand, contest, and hold accountable. What emerges is not primarily technical failure, but a loss of relational clarity: uncertainty about who is acting, on what grounds, and under which conditions responsibility can be meaningfully exercised across human, institutional, and algorithmic layers.

Current approaches to AI governance struggle to address this gap at a structural level. Dominant frameworks tend to emphasize isolated interactions between agents, the optimization and alignment of system outputs, or the imposition of formal boundaries through rules, audits, and compliance mechanisms. While each of these approaches captures a relevant dimension of hybrid human–AI systems, they typically operate in isolation and lack an integrated account of how governability is sustained—or gradually eroded—under conditions of high relational density, increasing automation, and tight institutional coupling.

Models centered on interaction typically examine human–AI relations at the level of interfaces, discrete decision points, or feedback loops. While analytically valuable, they often presuppose a stable relational environment in which interactions occur. This assumption limits their ability to account for the gradual degradation of shared meaning, trust, and interpretive orientation that can emerge even when interactions remain frequent, efficient, and technically functional. Consequently, such approaches struggle to explain systemic phenomena like the erosion of legitimacy, normalization of opaque decision-making, or breakdowns in collective sense-making within hybrid systems.

Optimization-driven models, common in AI alignment, control theory, and performance-focused governance, shift the focus from discrete interactions to system-level outcomes, framing coherence primarily in terms of consistency, efficiency, or convergence toward predefined objectives. Yet without an explicit structural account of boundaries or limits, these models risk producing forms of coerced coherence that suppress plural judgment, obscure responsibility, and generate brittle systemic behavior. Apparent alignment at the level of outputs may conceal deeper incoherence across normative, institutional, or temporal dimensions, leaving the system vulnerable despite superficial performance.

Together, these perspectives highlight a critical gap: existing models—whether interaction-focused or optimization-driven—capture important aspects of hybrid systems but fall short of providing a structural account of governability under conditions of high relational density, distributed agency, and institutional coupling.

Models centered on interaction typically analyze human–AI relations at the level of interfaces, discrete decision points, or feedback loops. While analytically valuable, these approaches often presuppose a stable relational environment in which interactions occur. As a result, they struggle to account for the gradual degradation of shared meaning, trust, and interpretive orientation that can unfold even when interactions remain frequent, efficient, and technically functional. Systemic phenomena such as the erosion of legitimacy, the normalization of opaque decision-making, or breakdowns in collective sense-making are therefore difficult to explain within purely interactional frameworks.

Optimization-driven models, common in AI alignment, control theory, and performance-focused governance, address some of these limitations by emphasizing consistency, efficiency, and convergence toward predefined objectives. However, when coherence is defined primarily in terms of output alignment, and without an explicit structural account of boundaries or limits, such approaches risk producing forms of coerced coherence. These configurations may suppress plural judgment, obscure responsibility, and generate brittle systemic behavior. Apparent alignment at the level of performance can thus conceal deeper incoherence across normative, institutional, or temporal dimensions, leaving the system vulnerable despite technical success.

Regulatory and compliance-based approaches, by contrast, foreground boundaries, constraints, and formal accountability mechanisms as primary tools of governance. Although indispensable, these approaches frequently operate without a relational understanding of the systems they seek to govern. Limits imposed without sensitivity to field dynamics and coherence processes may become symbolic, selectively enforced, or actively destabilizing. In such cases, boundaries fail to sustain meaningful accountability or adaptive capacity, and may inadvertently undermine the very relational conditions required for effective governance.

The core problem addressed in this paper is therefore not the absence of governance mechanisms, but the lack of an integrated structural model capable of explaining how governability emerges and deteriorates in hybrid human–AI systems. Existing frameworks tend to treat field conditions, coherence processes, and limits as separable concerns, rather than as mutually constitutive elements of a single relational structure.

This fragmentation obscures early signs of systemic drift. Hybrid systems may continue to meet performance benchmarks and compliance requirements while progressively losing relational legibility, diffusing responsibility, and undermining institutional trust. Governance failures thus tend to be detected only after harm has occurred, when corrective intervention is costly, contested, or ineffective.

This paper addresses this gap by formulating the problem of AI governance as a structural problem of relational coherence. It argues that governability in hybrid human–AI systems depends on a minimal and irreducible triadic structure composed of Field, Coherence, and Limit. Without an explicit account of how these elements interact, governance efforts remain reactive, fragmented, and vulnerable to cascading failure.

By articulating this problem, the paper shifts the focus of AI governance from controlling behavior or optimizing outputs to sustaining the structural conditions under which agency, accountability, and meaning remain intelligible over time. This reframing establishes the foundation for the triadic model developed in subsequent sections and for the adaptive governance implications derived from it.
