# 05 — Coherence

## 5.1 Definition of Coherence

Within hybrid human–AI–institutional systems, **Coherence** is defined as the
**structural compatibility and intelligibility of interactions occurring within a field over time**.

Coherence is not consensus, alignment of values, or behavioral uniformity.
It is a **systemic property** that determines whether interactions:

- Remain mutually interpretable
- Produce non-contradictory outcomes
- Preserve functional continuity across agents and subsystems

Formally, a system exhibits coherence when its internal relations do not generate persistent contradiction, fragmentation, or destabilizing feedback loops.

## 5.2 Coherence as a Structural Property

Coherence is an **emergent structural condition**, not a subjective perception or normative judgment.

A system may appear orderly while being structurally incoherent.
Conversely, a system may allow diversity and disagreement while remaining coherent.

Coherence exists when:

- Actions taken within the field are compatible with its constraints
- Feedback loops reinforce intelligibility rather than amplify noise
- Decisions across subsystems do not negate one another

It is therefore possible to analyze coherence independently of moral evaluation, while recognizing its necessity for governability.

## 5.3 Dimensions of Coherence

Coherence manifests across multiple structural dimensions:

1. **Semantic coherence**  
   Shared interpretability of signals, categories, and outputs across agents.

2. **Operational coherence**  
   Compatibility of procedures, protocols, and decision rules.

3. **Temporal coherence**  
   Alignment between system response times, learning cycles, and institutional rhythms.

4. **Relational coherence**  
   Stability of expectations among interacting agents and subsystems.

5. **Causal coherence**  
   Traceability between actions, decisions, and outcomes.

A breakdown in any of these dimensions can compromise overall system coherence.

## 5.4 Coherence in Hybrid Human–AI Systems

Hybrid systems face unique coherence challenges due to asymmetries between human and artificial components.

Common sources of incoherence include:

- Divergent interpretive models between humans and algorithms
- Optimization objectives misaligned with institutional goals
- Automated decisions operating beyond human temporal or cognitive scales
- Model updates altering system behavior without institutional adaptation

In such systems, incoherence often emerges not from malfunction, but from **structural misalignment**.

## 5.5 Coherence and Trust

Trust is not the cause of coherence; it is a **consequence** of sustained coherence.

When systems exhibit coherence:

- Agents can form reliable expectations
- Responsibility can be meaningfully attributed
- Errors can be identified and corrected

Conversely, persistent incoherence leads to erosion of trust, even in technically functional systems.

Trust collapse is therefore best understood as a **symptom of structural incoherence**, not merely a social or psychological phenomenon.

## 5.6 Pathological Incoherence Patterns

Several recurring incoherence patterns are observed in contemporary hybrid systems:

- **Semantic drift**  
  When system outputs change meaning faster than users can adapt.

- **Feedback misalignment**  
  When optimization loops reinforce unintended behaviors.

- **Responsibility diffusion**  
  When causal chains cross institutional and algorithmic boundaries without accountability.

- **Temporal desynchronization**  
  When automated processes outpace governance mechanisms.

These patterns often coexist and reinforce one another.

## 5.7 Coherence as a Necessary but Insufficient Condition

While coherence is essential for system stability, it does not prevent overextension, exploitation, or systemic harm on its own.

A system may be internally coherent while producing unsustainable or unjust outcomes if:

- It lacks explicit boundaries
- Its operational scope expands unchecked
- Its effects exceed institutional capacity

Therefore, coherence must be structurally constrained.

## 5.8 Relationship Between Field and Coherence

Field and coherence are distinct but interdependent.

- The **field** defines the relational space in which interactions occur.
- **Coherence** determines whether those interactions remain intelligible and compatible over time.

A poorly defined field undermines coherence.
A coherent system cannot exist in a structurally incoherent field.

However, even a coherent field–system configuration requires limits to remain sustainable.

## 5.9 Transition to Limit

If *Field* defines *where* interactions occur,
and *Coherence* defines *how* they remain intelligible,

then *Limit* defines **how far** a system may expand, adapt, or automate without destabilizing itself.

The next section introduces **Limit** as a structural condition for systemic sustainability and governability.
