## **7.3 Relational Dynamics Within the Triad**

### **Dyadic Interactions**

1. **Field–Coherence:**

   * Field sets structural preconditions for coherence.
   * Coherence reinforces and reshapes the Field via feedback loops.
2. **Coherence–Limit:**

   * Limits stabilize coherence, prevent rigidity or fragmentation.
   * Over-coherence → rigidity; under-limitation → instability.
3. **Field–Limit:**

   * Limits are enacted within Field, reshaping relational structure.

# 7. The Triadic Structure of Relational Coherence

This section integrates the previously defined concepts of Field, Coherence, and Limit into a unified structural model. Rather than treating these concepts as independent analytical lenses, we propose a triadic structure in which each element is mutually constitutive and necessary for systemic governability in hybrid human–AI systems.

## 7.1 Rationale for a Triadic Model

The increasing complexity of hybrid human–AI systems has revealed structural limitations in prevailing analytical and governance frameworks. Most existing models rely on dyadic or modular approaches that isolate interactions, optimization processes, or boundary mechanisms. While each of these perspectives captures relevant aspects of system behavior, none is sufficient to account for systemic governability under conditions of relational density, institutional coupling, and algorithmic mediation.

Interaction-centered models, common in socio-technical systems research, tend to focus on agents, interfaces, and information exchanges. When decoupled from an explicit notion of Field, such models implicitly assume a neutral or given relational substrate. As a result, they struggle to explain phenomena such as erosion of trust, loss of shared meaning, or fragmentation of collective sense-making, which emerge not from discrete interactions but from transformations in the relational environment itself.

Conversely, optimization-based models of coherence—prevalent in AI alignment, control theory, and performance-driven governance—treat coherence primarily as a function of efficiency, consistency, or convergence toward predefined objectives. In the absence of an explicit concept of Limit, these approaches risk producing forms of enforced coherence that suppress plurality, obscure responsibility, and generate systemic brittleness. Coherence, when detached from articulated limits, can become indistinguishable from control.

Boundary-centric governance frameworks, including regulatory and compliance-based approaches, emphasize limits, rules, and constraints as primary instruments of control. While indispensable, such frameworks often operate without a structural understanding of relational coherence. Limits imposed without regard to the relational field and its dynamics may either fail to stabilize the system or inadvertently destabilize it by disrupting informal coordination, trust relations, or adaptive capacities.

The triadic model proposed in this paper responds to these limitations by treating Field, Coherence, and Limit as mutually constitutive structural conditions rather than independent variables. Field provides the relational substrate in which interactions acquire meaning; Coherence functions as the dynamic alignment process that sustains intelligibility across system layers; and Limit operates as the boundary condition that enables responsibility, differentiation, and long-term stability.

We argue that this triadic structure represents a minimal and irreducible condition for sustaining governability in hybrid human–AI systems. Removing any one of the three elements results in systemic pathologies: ungrounded interaction, coercive coherence, or brittle boundary enforcement. The triadic model thus offers a structurally integrated alternative to dyadic and modular approaches, capable of addressing the relational, normative, and operational challenges posed by contemporary hybrid systems.

## 7.2 Structural Definitions and Roles

This subsection repositions Field, Coherence, and Limit not as isolated properties, but as structural roles within a unified system.

### 7.2.1 Field as Relational Substrate

In the proposed triadic model, *Field* is understood as the relational substrate that enables the emergence, persistence, and transformation of relations within a system. It is not a background container in which interactions merely occur, but a constitutive condition that shapes what kinds of relations are possible, intelligible, and sustainable.

The field precedes discrete interactions in a structural sense. Agents—human, artificial, or institutional—do not relate in a vacuum; their interactions are always already conditioned by a shared relational environment that carries expectations, norms, affordances, and asymmetries. This environment is what we designate as the field. Without an articulated concept of field, relational dynamics are reduced to isolated exchanges, obscuring the systemic patterns through which meaning, trust, and coordination emerge.

Crucially, the field is not reducible to the sum of agents, interfaces, or data flows. While it is instantiated through these elements, it cannot be fully described by them. Data infrastructures, communication protocols, organizational charts, and algorithmic interfaces participate in shaping the field, but none exhaust its structure. The field includes informal norms, tacit expectations, power relations, temporal rhythms, and shared interpretive frames that operate across and between formal system components.

In hybrid human–AI systems, the relational field is dynamically shaped by the interaction of institutional arrangements, technological architectures, and human practices. Institutional policies and governance frameworks contribute to defining legitimate forms of action and responsibility; technological systems modulate visibility, speed, and scale of interaction; and human actors continuously adapt, resist, or reinterpret both institutional and technological constraints. The field thus evolves over time, often in ways that are only partially legible to system designers or regulators.

Understanding field as a relational substrate allows us to account for systemic phenomena that cannot be explained by agent-level behavior alone, such as loss of collective sense-making, normalization of opaque decision processes, or gradual erosion of accountability. Within the triadic structure, field provides the ground upon which coherence can emerge and within which limits acquire meaning. Without field sensitivity, attempts to engineer coherence or impose limits risk operating on an abstracted system that no longer corresponds to the lived relational reality of hybrid human–AI environments.

### 7.2.2 Coherence as a Systemic Alignment Process

In this model, coherence is defined not as a static state of equilibrium or optimization, but as a dynamic and ongoing process of alignment across multiple dimensions of a system. Rather than referring to internal consistency alone, coherence describes the capacity of a system to sustain meaningful relational integration over time while remaining responsive to contextual variation.

First, coherence is inherently temporal. Hybrid human–AI systems operate across heterogeneous timescales: human deliberation, institutional procedures, and computational processes evolve at different speeds and rhythms. Coherence emerges when these temporal layers are sufficiently aligned to allow actions, decisions, and feedback to remain mutually intelligible. Temporal incoherence—such as automated actions outpacing human oversight or institutional response—produces breakdowns in accountability and trust.

Second, coherence is functional. It requires alignment between the roles, responsibilities, and operational logics of different system components. In hybrid systems, this includes humans, technical artifacts, algorithms, interfaces, and institutional frameworks. Functional incoherence arises when optimization goals, decision criteria, or control mechanisms conflict across layers, resulting in fragmented agency or unintended systemic effects.

Third, coherence is normative. Systems are not value-neutral: they embed assumptions about responsibility, legitimacy, fairness, and acceptable risk. Normative coherence refers to the alignment between declared values, implemented rules, and actual system behavior. When normative commitments are decoupled from operational reality—such as ethical principles that lack enforcement mechanisms—coherence erodes, even if the system remains technically functional.

Across these dimensions, coherence plays a central role in sustaining intelligibility within hybrid systems. Intelligibility refers to the ability of system participants to understand how decisions are made, how actions propagate, and where responsibility resides. Without sufficient coherence, systems may continue to operate while becoming opaque, unpredictable, or socially illegible.

Finally, coherence is a precondition for trust. Trust does not emerge from performance alone, but from the perceived reliability and interpretability of relational processes over time. In hybrid human–AI systems, coherence enables trust by stabilizing expectations, clarifying agency boundaries, and maintaining continuity between intention, action, and outcome.

In this sense, coherence is not an optional optimization goal, but a structural requirement for the governability and sustainability of complex relational systems.

### 7.2.3 Limit as a Structural Boundary Condition

Within the proposed triadic model, *limit* is not understood as a mere restriction imposed on system behavior, but as a generative structural condition that enables agency, responsibility, and relational stability. Limits define the contours within which coherent interaction becomes possible, preventing both uncontrolled expansion and systemic ambiguity.

As a generative constraint, limit functions by shaping the space of possible actions rather than by prohibiting action altogether. In complex systems, the absence of well-articulated limits does not produce freedom, but rather indeterminacy, diffusion of responsibility, and loss of governability. Conversely, appropriately defined limits enable differentiation of roles, clarification of authority, and the emergence of accountable agency across system components.

Limits are therefore essential for responsibility and accountability. In hybrid human–AI systems, actions are distributed across human actors, technical systems, and institutional frameworks. Without clear boundary conditions, it becomes impossible to attribute responsibility for decisions, errors, or harms. Limits establish who can act, under what conditions, and with which forms of oversight, thereby sustaining ethical and legal intelligibility.

Furthermore, limits are necessary for agency differentiation. Human agency, institutional agency, and automated or algorithmic agency operate according to distinct logics and capacities. Treating these forms of agency as interchangeable or indistinct leads to governance failures, including over-automation, moral offloading, or unjust attribution of blame. Structural limits preserve the specificity of each form of agency while enabling coordinated interaction within the system.

A crucial distinction must be made between *explicit* and *implicit* limits. Explicit limits include formally articulated constraints such as policies, regulations, technical protocols, access controls, and procedural rules. These limits are codified, inspectable, and often enforceable through institutional mechanisms.

Implicit limits, by contrast, arise from cognitive, institutional, and ethical conditions. Cognitive limits concern human attention, comprehension, and decision-making capacity. Institutional limits emerge from organizational structures, cultural norms, and historical practices. Ethical limits reflect shared values, moral intuitions, and socially negotiated boundaries of acceptable action. Although less visible, implicit limits exert a profound influence on system behavior and often determine whether explicit limits are effective or merely symbolic.

Structural incoherence arises when explicit and implicit limits are misaligned—for example, when formal governance frameworks exceed human cognitive capacity, or when ethical expectations are not supported by institutional design. In such cases, limits may exist in name while failing to function as stabilizing boundary conditions.

In the triadic model, limit operates in continuous relation with field and coherence. Limits shape the topology of the relational field and stabilize coherence over time, while coherence ensures that limits remain intelligible and legitimate within the field. Together, these interactions position limit not as an obstacle to system performance, but as a foundational condition for sustainable, accountable, and governable hybrid systems.

## 7.3 Relational Dynamics Within the Triad

While Field, Coherence, and Limit can be analytically distinguished, their significance emerges only through their dynamic interaction. The triadic structure proposed in this paper is not static or hierarchical; it is relational and processual. Each component continuously shapes and is shaped by the others, generating systemic patterns of stability, adaptation, or breakdown. This subsection formalizes these relational dynamics by examining the three primary dyadic interactions within the triad.

### 7.3.1 Field–Coherence Interaction

The relational field conditions the forms of coherence that can emerge within a system. Because the field defines what relations are possible, intelligible, and legitimate, it sets the structural preconditions for alignment processes across system components. Coherence does not arise independently of the field; it is always coherence *within* a particular relational topology.

In fields characterized by high relational density—where interactions are frequent, mediated across multiple layers, and institutionally entangled—coherence requires continuous negotiation and recalibration. Alignment in such contexts is inherently fragile: small shifts in norms, interfaces, or power asymmetries can propagate widely, producing systemic effects that exceed localized interactions. Conversely, sparse or weakly articulated fields may fail to sustain coherence altogether, as participants lack shared reference frames necessary for mutual intelligibility.

The interaction between field and coherence is mediated through feedback loops. As coherence stabilizes expectations and interpretive frames, it reinforces the structure of the field, making certain relations more durable and others less salient. At the same time, changes in the field—such as the introduction of new AI-mediated decision systems, institutional reforms, or shifts in participation—can destabilize existing coherence patterns. In this sense, coherence both depends on and actively reshapes the field.

Importantly, attempts to engineer coherence without attending to the relational field often result in superficial or brittle alignment. For example, algorithmic standardization may produce apparent consistency in outputs while masking deep incoherence at the level of meaning, responsibility, or trust. Field–coherence sensitivity is therefore essential for distinguishing between genuine systemic alignment and merely formal or enforced coherence.

### 7.3.2 Coherence–Limit Interaction

Limits play a critical role in stabilizing coherence by preventing alignment processes from collapsing into rigidity or overreach. Coherence, left unchecked, can become self-reinforcing to the point of suppressing plurality, adaptability, and critical contestation. In such cases, coherence shifts from a relational integrative process to a mechanism of control.

Well-articulated limits function as stabilizers that preserve the openness of coherence. By defining boundaries of authority, scope of action, and conditions of override or exception, limits ensure that coherence remains responsive rather than totalizing. They enable systems to maintain alignment while accommodating diversity of perspectives, contextual variation, and ethical dissent.

At the same time, insufficient or poorly defined limits undermine coherence. Under-limitation leads to fragmentation, as alignment processes lack anchoring conditions for responsibility and decision-making. In hybrid human–AI systems, this often manifests as diffusion of agency: automated processes operate without clear oversight, while human actors are unable to intervene meaningfully due to opacity or scale.

The coherence–limit interaction thus involves a continuous balancing act. Over-coherence produces rigidity, path dependence, and suppression of alternative interpretations; under-limitation produces instability, ambiguity, and loss of governability. Sustainable systems require limits that are neither merely restrictive nor purely symbolic, but structurally integrated into coherence processes themselves.

### 7.3.3 Field–Limit Interaction

Limits are not imposed on a neutral substrate; they are enacted within the relational field and, in doing so, actively reshape it. Boundary-setting is therefore a relational act rather than a purely technical or legal intervention. The effectiveness of limits depends on how they are interpreted, internalized, and negotiated within the field.

When limits are well-aligned with the relational field, they clarify expectations, reinforce legitimate authority, and enhance trust. For instance, transparent institutional limits on automated decision-making can stabilize human–AI relations by making the scope and consequences of algorithmic action intelligible to affected participants. In such cases, limits contribute to field legibility and relational predictability.

Conversely, limits that are misaligned with the field may either fail to function or generate unintended consequences. Formal constraints that ignore informal practices, power dynamics, or cognitive realities may be circumvented, ignored, or selectively enforced. This can lead to the emergence of shadow practices that further destabilize the field, eroding both coherence and accountability.

Institutional limits are particularly significant as field-shaping mechanisms. Policies, regulations, and governance frameworks do not merely constrain behavior; they signal normative priorities and redistribute relational power. In hybrid systems, institutional limits determine how AI systems are positioned within the field—whether as tools, agents, advisors, or authorities—and thereby shape the entire relational topology.

Within the triadic structure, the field–limit interaction ensures that boundaries remain meaningful rather than abstract. Limits acquire legitimacy only insofar as they resonate with the lived relational conditions of the system. At the same time, the articulation of limits can transform the field by redefining roles, responsibilities, and modes of participation. This mutual shaping underscores why limits cannot be treated as external constraints, but must be understood as integral components of relational system design.

## 7.4 Conditions of Stability and Rupture

The analysis of dyadic interactions in the previous subsection demonstrates that Field, Coherence, and Limit operate through continuous and mutually constitutive dynamics. However, the mere presence of these interactions does not, by itself, ensure the long-term sustainability of the system. This subsection therefore shifts the analytical focus from relational dynamics to the **structural conditions** under which those dynamics remain stable—or, alternatively, give rise to systemic rupture.

This subsection identifies the conditions under which the triadic structure sustains or collapses.

### 7.4.1 Structural Stability Conditions

The stability of the triadic structure depends on a set of necessary—though not sufficient—conditions that allow Field, Coherence, and Limit to remain mutually reinforcing over time. Structural stability does not imply stasis or absence of conflict; rather, it denotes the capacity of the system to absorb variation, contestation, and change without losing governability or relational intelligibility. Three interdependent conditions are particularly critical: minimum coherence thresholds, adequate limit articulation, and field transparency and legibility.

**Minimum coherence thresholds.**
For a hybrid human–AI system to remain governable, coherence must exceed a minimal threshold across temporal, functional, and normative dimensions. Below this threshold, system components may continue to operate locally, but the system as a whole becomes unintelligible and unaccountable.

Minimum coherence does not require full alignment or consensus. Instead, it requires sufficient integration for system participants to (a) understand how actions propagate across layers, (b) anticipate the consequences of interventions, and (c) locate responsibility for decisions and outcomes. When coherence falls below this threshold, breakdowns manifest as opaque decision chains, conflicting operational logics, and erosion of trust—even in systems that remain technically performant.

Importantly, coherence thresholds are context-dependent. High-stakes domains such as healthcare, public administration, or judicial systems require higher coherence thresholds than low-impact or exploratory environments. Structural stability therefore demands not maximal coherence, but coherence calibrated to the system’s social, ethical, and institutional context.

**Adequate limit articulation.**
Structural stability further depends on the presence of limits that are sufficiently articulated, enforceable, and intelligible within the relational field. Limits must clearly define scopes of authority, conditions of action, and mechanisms of accountability across human, institutional, and technical components.

Inadequately articulated limits—whether overly vague, excessively complex, or misaligned with system practices—fail to function as stabilizing boundary conditions. Such failures often result in either limit erosion, where boundaries exist formally but not operationally, or limit overextension, where constraints proliferate without meaningful integration into system dynamics.

Adequate limit articulation requires coherence between explicit and implicit limits. Formal rules, policies, and technical constraints must be compatible with human cognitive capacities, institutional routines, and ethical expectations. When this alignment is absent, limits become symbolic or performative, undermining both coherence and legitimacy. Stability is achieved not through the sheer presence of limits, but through their structural integration into relational processes.

**Field transparency and legibility.**
The third condition of stability concerns the transparency and legibility of the relational field itself. Field transparency refers to the degree to which the structure of relations—roles, dependencies, decision pathways, and power asymmetries—is visible and interpretable to system participants. Legibility, in turn, denotes the capacity of actors to make sense of these structures and orient their actions accordingly.

Opaque or illegible fields undermine stability even when coherence and limits are formally present. Participants may comply with rules or interact with systems without understanding how outcomes are produced or how responsibilities are distributed. In such environments, trust becomes fragile, contestation becomes distorted, and corrective feedback loops fail to function.

In hybrid human–AI systems, field opacity is often amplified by algorithmic mediation, scale, and speed. Automated decision-making can obscure causal chains, while institutional layering can diffuse accountability. Structural stability therefore requires deliberate efforts to render the field legible—through transparency mechanisms, interpretability practices, participatory governance structures, and reflexive oversight.

Crucially, field transparency does not imply total visibility or full disclosure. Rather, it requires that the relational structure be sufficiently intelligible to support informed participation, meaningful oversight, and responsible intervention. Excessive opacity destabilizes the triadic structure by decoupling coherence from lived relational reality and by rendering limits abstract or unenforceable.

Taken together, these three conditions delineate the minimal structural requirements for sustaining the triadic model. When minimum coherence thresholds are met, limits are adequately articulated, and the field remains transparent and legible, hybrid human–AI systems retain the capacity for adaptive governance. When one or more of these conditions fail, the system becomes vulnerable to modes of rupture analyzed in the following subsection.

### 7.4.2 Modes of Rupture

When the structural conditions outlined above are not met, the triadic structure becomes vulnerable to distinct but interrelated modes of rupture. These ruptures do not necessarily manifest as immediate system failure; rather, they often emerge gradually, through erosion of relational intelligibility, accountability, or adaptive capacity. This subsection analyzes three primary modes of rupture—field collapse, coherence breakdown, and limit erosion or overextension—focusing on their systemic consequences for governance and decision-making in hybrid human–AI systems.

**Field collapse (loss of shared relational ground).**
Field collapse occurs when the relational substrate that enables shared meaning, expectation, and coordination disintegrates. In such conditions, system participants no longer operate within a common relational environment, even if formal structures and interactions persist. The loss of shared relational ground undermines collective sense-making and renders coordination increasingly fragile.

In hybrid systems, field collapse often results from cumulative opacity, asymmetrical power redistribution, or rapid technological mediation that outpaces institutional and cultural adaptation. Algorithmic systems may reconfigure relational dynamics—such as authority, visibility, or participation—without corresponding updates to shared interpretive frames. Over time, participants lose the ability to situate actions within a coherent relational context.

The governance consequences of field collapse are severe. Decision-making becomes fragmented, as actors interpret system behavior through incompatible or incomplete frames of reference. Trust deteriorates, not necessarily due to malice or error, but because the system no longer provides a stable ground for mutual intelligibility. In such environments, formal governance mechanisms may remain in place while losing practical effectiveness, as they no longer resonate with the lived relational reality of the system.

**Coherence breakdown (misalignment across system layers).**
Coherence breakdown arises when alignment across temporal, functional, or normative dimensions deteriorates below a viable threshold. Unlike field collapse, which concerns the erosion of the relational substrate itself, coherence breakdown involves misalignment among system components that continue to share a field but fail to operate intelligibly together.

In hybrid human–AI systems, coherence breakdown frequently manifests as temporal misalignment—automated processes operating at speeds incompatible with human oversight or institutional response—or as functional misalignment, where optimization criteria embedded in AI systems conflict with organizational goals or ethical commitments. Normative misalignment is particularly destabilizing, as it decouples declared values from operational practice.

The systemic consequences include opaque decision chains, contradictory outcomes, and diffusion of responsibility. Governance mechanisms struggle to intervene effectively because breakdowns occur not at a single point of failure, but across interacting layers. Systems may appear operationally successful while becoming socially illegible and normatively incoherent. Over time, this condition erodes legitimacy and undermines the capacity for corrective action.

**Limit erosion or overextension.**
The third mode of rupture concerns failures in the articulation and functioning of limits. Limit erosion occurs when boundaries that once structured responsibility and authority gradually lose force—through normalization of exceptions, automation without oversight, or institutional fatigue. Overextension, by contrast, arises when limits proliferate excessively or rigidly, constraining system adaptability and suppressing legitimate variation.

In hybrid systems, limit erosion often takes the form of unexamined delegation to automated processes. As AI systems become embedded in decision-making, human and institutional actors may defer responsibility, assuming that technical constraints suffice as governance mechanisms. This erodes accountability and obscures the conditions under which intervention is possible or required.

Limit overextension produces a different but equally destabilizing effect. Excessive regulation, rigid proceduralization, or over-specification of constraints can inhibit learning, adaptation, and contextual judgment. In such cases, actors may engage in performative compliance, adhering to formal limits while circumventing their spirit in practice. Both erosion and overextension decouple limits from the relational field, rendering them ineffective as stabilizing boundary conditions.

Across all three modes of rupture, a common pattern emerges: governance failure is not primarily the result of isolated errors, but of structural misalignment within the triadic system. Field collapse undermines shared meaning, coherence breakdown disrupts intelligibility across layers, and limit failures dissolve responsibility and accountability. These ruptures reinforce one another, often producing cascading effects that are difficult to reverse once entrenched.

Understanding these modes of rupture is therefore essential for diagnosing systemic fragility in hybrid human–AI systems. Rather than focusing solely on technical performance or rule compliance, governance frameworks must attend to the relational integrity of the triadic structure itself. Only by doing so can systems remain resilient, intelligible, and ethically governable over time.

## 7.5 Implications for Hybrid Human–AI Systems

This subsection bridges the abstract structure to the domain of hybrid systems.

* How AI systems participate in and reshape the relational field
* Risks of coherence enforced through automation without field sensitivity
* Limits as essential safeguards against unaccountable systemic agency

### 7.5.1 AI Participation in the Relational Field

Hybrid human–AI systems are characterized not only by the presence of algorithmic agents but also by the active participation of these agents in shaping the relational substrate of the system. In the triadic model, AI does not operate in a vacuum; its interventions occur within a pre-existing **Field** and simultaneously contribute to the dynamic evolution of that Field. Understanding the mechanisms, dynamics, and feedback effects of AI participation is essential for anticipating systemic consequences and designing resilient governance structures.

**Mechanisms of AI interaction within the Field.**
AI algorithms function as both **mediators and relational agents**. As mediators, they influence the patterns of interaction among human actors by filtering information, highlighting or suppressing certain communication channels, and prioritizing particular decision pathways. As relational agents, AI systems contribute their own outputs to the Field, establishing dependencies, expectations, and potential points of coordination or conflict with human and institutional actors.

The participation of AI directly affects the **visibility of actions, temporal rhythm, and informational flows**. For example, automated recommendations or predictive systems may accelerate decision-making beyond human temporal capacities, while AI-generated summaries or alerts may selectively highlight certain relations, reshaping attention and interpretive focus. In each case, the Field itself is modified by the presence and behavior of AI agents.

**Dynamic reconfiguration of the Field.**
AI interventions can **alter relational density**—the number, frequency, and interconnectedness of interactions within the Field—as well as the **distribution of tacit expectations** among participants. High-density AI-mediated environments may amplify coordination by providing shared informational substrates, but they can also introduce congestion, attention overload, or subtle power asymmetries. AI systems may inadvertently privilege certain pathways or participants, reinforcing existing hierarchies or creating new relational patterns that were not anticipated in institutional design.

The implications of Field reconfiguration extend to **trust, shared meaning, and coordination**. Changes in the Field can stabilize expectations when AI outputs are consistent, interpretable, and aligned with institutional norms. Conversely, opaque or unpredictable AI behavior can erode trust and collective intelligibility, contributing to latent fragility even in systems that maintain high technical performance.

**Feedback loops and systemic effects.**
The interaction between AI and the Field is inherently recursive. **Changes induced by AI feed back into both Coherence and Limit**, altering how alignment processes operate and how boundaries are interpreted. For instance, algorithmically mediated coordination may strengthen functional coherence by synchronizing actions across layers, yet simultaneously challenge normative coherence if outputs conflict with ethical guidelines or human expectations. Similarly, the Field’s response to AI interventions may require the recalibration of explicit and implicit limits to preserve intelligibility and accountability.

These **feedback loops** can produce either **reinforcing stability or emergent instability**. Positive reinforcement occurs when AI contributions harmonize with human and institutional processes, stabilizing both the Field and the triadic interactions. Instability arises when AI interventions disrupt relational patterns, overloading coherence mechanisms or challenging existing limits, potentially precipitating the types of rupture described in Section 7.4.2. Understanding these dynamics is therefore critical for designing hybrid systems that remain adaptable, intelligible, and ethically accountable.

### 7.5.2 Risks of Coherence Enforced Through Automation

While algorithmic systems can facilitate alignment and reduce operational friction, **overreliance on automated coherence** introduces systemic risks when the relational Field is insufficiently considered. Coherence enforced through automation—though appearing effective on a technical level—can generate vulnerabilities in intelligibility, accountability, and adaptability if the structural dynamics of the triad are neglected.

**Overreliance on algorithmic alignment.**
Automated processes may impose apparent coherence by optimizing decision outputs, synchronizing actions across layers, or enforcing procedural consistency. However, without sensitivity to the Field, these interventions risk **producing coherence that is decoupled from relational reality**. Participants may perceive the system as internally aligned, yet the underlying social, cognitive, or institutional structures remain partially disconnected. This misalignment can undermine trust, reduce interpretability, and obscure the conditions under which human or institutional intervention is possible.

**Risks of rigidity and suppression of plurality.**
Coherence imposed mechanically may **limit the diversity of perspectives, approaches, or interpretations** within the system. Uniform algorithmic decision-making can inadvertently enforce path dependence, reducing flexibility and adaptive capacity. In complex hybrid systems, this rigidity may hinder the ability to respond effectively to unforeseen events, novel information, or ethical dilemmas, amplifying the likelihood of latent systemic failure.

**Disconnection between normativity and operationality.**
Automated coherence often emphasizes functional or procedural alignment, while neglecting normative considerations embedded in the Field. When AI-driven actions conflict with declared institutional values, ethical norms, or social expectations, **normative coherence erodes**. Participants may comply technically with automated outputs while perceiving them as misaligned with institutional purpose, ethical obligations, or social legitimacy. This disjunction can further destabilize trust and challenge the legitimacy of governance mechanisms.

**Cascading governance effects.**
Failures in field-sensitive alignment propagate through the triadic structure, potentially affecting both Limits and overall coherence. Automated systems that produce consistent but opaque outputs may inadvertently **diffuse responsibility** across human and institutional actors. Misinterpretations or uncritical reliance on algorithmic outputs can generate feedback loops that amplify latent fragility, producing cascading effects that are difficult to detect and correct. This demonstrates that the **mechanical enforcement of coherence**, absent relational sensitivity, can paradoxically undermine both intelligibility and systemic stability.

In sum, while automation can support alignment, these risks underscore the necessity of integrating **Field awareness and Limit calibration** into the design, deployment, and monitoring of hybrid human–AI systems. Maintaining adaptive, intelligible, and accountable coherence requires more than algorithmic efficiency—it demands continuous attention to the relational and normative conditions in which the system operates.

### 7.5.3 Limits as Essential Safeguards

In hybrid human–AI systems, **Limits** serve as foundational mechanisms for maintaining intelligibility, accountability, and adaptive capacity. While AI participation and automated coherence can enhance system efficiency, without well-defined boundaries, these same mechanisms risk producing structural fragility. Limits operate not as mere constraints, but as **structural safeguards** that preserve the integrity of the triadic system.

**Preservation of differentiated agency.**
Explicit and implicit limits delineate the roles and responsibilities of **human actors, institutions, and algorithmic agents**. By maintaining clear differentiation, limits prevent over-automation, inappropriate delegation of decision authority, or conflation of responsibilities. This structural clarity ensures that each type of agent operates within its domain of competence, contributing to coordinated and accountable action within the Field.

**Accountability and distributed responsibility.**
Limits function as mechanisms for supervision and intervention, enabling participants to attribute responsibility appropriately. Explicit limits—such as policies, technical protocols, or procedural rules—provide inspectable frameworks for governance. Implicit limits, arising from cognitive, institutional, and ethical constraints, complement formal structures by shaping how actors interpret and exercise authority. Together, these boundaries ensure that accountability is **distributed and intelligible**, mitigating the risk of responsibility diffusion in complex hybrid systems.

**Prevention of systemic ruptures.**
Limits play a crucial role in mitigating **Field collapse** and **Coherence breakdown**, the primary modes of structural rupture identified in Section 7.4.2. By defining permissible actions, scopes of authority, and escalation pathways, limits stabilize relational dynamics and support intelligible alignment. Well-calibrated boundaries prevent excessive rigidity while avoiding under-limitation, sustaining both the adaptability and resilience of the system.

**Integration of limits into hybrid system design.**
Effective limits are embedded in system architecture, governance processes, and operational workflows. Examples include:

* Policy frameworks that specify conditions for automated decision-making
* Technical protocols that define intervention thresholds
* Alerts and monitoring systems that signal potential violations or anomalies
* Participatory governance mechanisms that involve stakeholders in reviewing and adjusting boundaries

Integrating limits into the design of hybrid systems ensures that AI and human agents operate **within a relationally intelligible and ethically coherent framework**, preserving both systemic stability and accountability. Limits are not obstacles to automation or alignment; they are **enablers of sustainable governance**, ensuring that Field and Coherence remain coherent, legible, and adaptable over time.

### 7.5.4 Integrative Observations

The previous subsections have examined the participation of AI in the relational Field, the risks associated with automated coherence, and the stabilizing function of Limits. This final subsection synthesizes these insights to highlight the **interdependence of Field, Coherence, and Limit in practice** and to outline **general principles for hybrid governance**.

**Field–Coherence–Limit interdependence in practice.**
Hybrid systems illustrate that the triadic elements are mutually reinforcing. AI can **strengthen the triad** when its outputs enhance intelligibility, stabilize alignment, and respect established boundaries. Conversely, AI interventions can **weaken the triad** when automation prioritizes efficiency over relational legibility, bypasses limits, or produces misalignment across temporal, functional, or normative layers. In practice, these effects are not isolated; changes in one component propagate through the others via feedback loops, emphasizing the systemic nature of relational coherence.

**General guidance for hybrid governance.**
Effective management of hybrid human–AI systems requires continuous attention to the triadic structure:

* **Continuous monitoring of the Field:** Ensure that relational patterns, power asymmetries, and interpretive frames remain intelligible to all relevant actors. Transparency and visibility mechanisms should be employed to maintain shared understanding.

* **Periodic evaluation of automated coherence:** Automated alignment should be assessed not only for efficiency but also for functional and normative compatibility. Misalignments must be detected and corrected before they destabilize system-wide intelligibility.

* **Adaptive review and calibration of Limits:** Limits should be revisited and adjusted in response to changes in the Field or Coherence. Both explicit and implicit boundaries must evolve to preserve differentiated agency, accountability, and system stability.

By applying these principles, governance mechanisms can **leverage AI’s capabilities** while safeguarding against the systemic risks identified in Section 7.4.2. The triadic model thus provides a conceptual and operational framework for designing, monitoring, and adapting hybrid human–AI systems in ways that sustain intelligibility, trust, and accountability over time.

## 7.6 Summary and Transition to Governance Implications

This chapter has presented a **triadic model of relational coherence**, integrating **Field, Coherence, and Limit** as mutually constitutive structural conditions essential for the governability of hybrid human–AI systems. Each component plays a distinct but interdependent role: the Field provides the relational substrate for meaningful interactions; Coherence sustains temporal, functional, and normative alignment; and Limits establish boundaries that enable accountability, agency differentiation, and systemic stability.

The analysis demonstrates that the triadic structure is **both minimal and irreducible**. Removing or weakening any one element produces systemic pathologies: ungrounded interaction when the Field is neglected, coercive or brittle alignment when Limits are absent, and opaque or misaligned processes when Coherence thresholds are insufficient. Furthermore, the dynamic interactions among the three components generate feedback loops that reinforce stability or precipitate gradual systemic rupture, as evidenced in the conditions and modes of instability described in Section 7.4.

The triadic model is **directly relevant for governance and institutional design**. By conceptualizing AI systems as participants within a relational Field and by acknowledging the structural necessity of Coherence and Limits, policymakers and institutional designers can anticipate risks of over-automation, misalignment, and opacity. The model provides a framework for **designing adaptive governance mechanisms**, ensuring that hybrid systems remain intelligible, accountable, and resilient over time.

In preparation for Section 8, the triadic framework serves as a **conceptual bridge between structural analysis and applied governance**. It informs the development of practical guidelines, institutional safeguards, and policy interventions aimed at sustaining relational coherence in socio-technical environments characterized by the integration of human and AI agents. The next chapter will extend this theoretical foundation to explore **specific governance strategies, oversight mechanisms, and policy implications**, illustrating how the triadic model can guide the design and evaluation of accountable, adaptive, and ethically aligned hybrid systems.
