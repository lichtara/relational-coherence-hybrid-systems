# 7. The Triadic Structure of Relational Coherence

This section integrates the previously defined concepts of Field, Coherence, and Limit into a unified structural model. Rather than treating these concepts as independent analytical lenses, we propose a triadic structure in which each element is mutually constitutive and necessary for systemic governability in hybrid human–AI systems.

## 7.1 Rationale for a Triadic Model

This subsection explains why a triadic structure is required, as opposed to dyadic or modular frameworks.

* Limitations of models focusing solely on interaction (without Field)
* Limitations of optimization-based coherence models (without Limit)
* Limitations of boundary-centric governance (without relational coherence)

The triadic model is introduced as a minimal structural condition for sustaining relational systems under increasing complexity.

## 7.2 Structural Definitions and Roles

This subsection repositions Field, Coherence, and Limit not as isolated properties, but as structural roles within a unified system.

### 7.2.1 Field as Relational Substrate

* Field as the enabling condition for relational emergence
* Field as non-reducible to agents, interfaces, or data flows
* Field as dynamically shaped by institutional, technological, and human factors

### 7.2.2 Coherence as Systemic Alignment Process

* Coherence as a dynamic condition, not a static equilibrium
* Coherence as alignment across temporal, functional, and normative dimensions
* The role of coherence in sustaining intelligibility and trust within hybrid systems

### 7.2.3 Limit as Structural Boundary Condition

* Limit as a generative constraint rather than a restriction
* Limits as necessary for responsibility, accountability, and agency differentiation
* Distinction between explicit limits (policies, protocols) and implicit limits (cognitive, institutional, ethical)

## 7.3 Relational Dynamics Within the Triad

This subsection formalizes how the three components interact dynamically.

### 7.3.1 Field–Coherence Interaction

* How the structure of the field conditions possible forms of coherence
* Feedback loops between relational density and coherence stability

### 7.3.2 Coherence–Limit Interaction

* Limits as stabilizers of coherence
* Risks of over-coherence (rigidity, suppression of diversity)
* Risks of under-limitation (fragmentation, instability)

### 7.3.3 Field–Limit Interaction

* How limits shape the topology of the field
* Boundary-setting as a relational act within the field
* Institutional limits as field-shaping mechanisms

## 7.4 Conditions of Stability and Rupture

This subsection identifies the conditions under which the triadic structure sustains or collapses.

### 7.4.1 Structural Stability Conditions

* Minimum coherence thresholds
* Adequate limit articulation
* Field transparency and legibility

### 7.4.2 Modes of Rupture

* Field collapse (loss of shared relational ground)
* Coherence breakdown (misalignment, incoherence across system layers)
* Limit erosion or overextension

Each mode of rupture is analyzed in terms of systemic consequences for governance and decision-making.

## 7.5 Implications for Hybrid Human–AI Systems

This subsection bridges the abstract structure to the domain of hybrid systems.

* How AI systems participate in and reshape the relational field
* Risks of coherence enforced through automation without field sensitivity
* Limits as essential safeguards against unaccountable systemic agency

## 7.6 Summary and Transition to Governance Implications

This closing subsection synthesizes the triadic model and prepares the transition to Section 8.

* Recap of the triadic structure as a governance-relevant model
* Justification for applying the model to institutional and policy design
* Preview of governance implications developed in the next section
