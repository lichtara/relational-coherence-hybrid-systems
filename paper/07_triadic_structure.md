# 7. The Triadic Structure of Relational Coherence

This section integrates the previously defined concepts of Field, Coherence, and Limit into a unified structural model. Rather than treating these concepts as independent analytical lenses, we propose a triadic structure in which each element is mutually constitutive and necessary for systemic governability in hybrid human–AI systems.

## 7.1 Rationale for a Triadic Model

The increasing complexity of hybrid human–AI systems has revealed structural limitations in prevailing analytical and governance frameworks. Most existing models rely on dyadic or modular approaches that isolate interactions, optimization processes, or boundary mechanisms. While each of these perspectives captures relevant aspects of system behavior, none is sufficient to account for systemic governability under conditions of relational density, institutional coupling, and algorithmic mediation.

Interaction-centered models, common in socio-technical systems research, tend to focus on agents, interfaces, and information exchanges. When decoupled from an explicit notion of Field, such models implicitly assume a neutral or given relational substrate. As a result, they struggle to explain phenomena such as erosion of trust, loss of shared meaning, or fragmentation of collective sense-making, which emerge not from discrete interactions but from transformations in the relational environment itself.

Conversely, optimization-based models of coherence—prevalent in AI alignment, control theory, and performance-driven governance—treat coherence primarily as a function of efficiency, consistency, or convergence toward predefined objectives. In the absence of an explicit concept of Limit, these approaches risk producing forms of enforced coherence that suppress plurality, obscure responsibility, and generate systemic brittleness. Coherence, when detached from articulated limits, can become indistinguishable from control.

Boundary-centric governance frameworks, including regulatory and compliance-based approaches, emphasize limits, rules, and constraints as primary instruments of control. While indispensable, such frameworks often operate without a structural understanding of relational coherence. Limits imposed without regard to the relational field and its dynamics may either fail to stabilize the system or inadvertently destabilize it by disrupting informal coordination, trust relations, or adaptive capacities.

The triadic model proposed in this paper responds to these limitations by treating Field, Coherence, and Limit as mutually constitutive structural conditions rather than independent variables. Field provides the relational substrate in which interactions acquire meaning; Coherence functions as the dynamic alignment process that sustains intelligibility across system layers; and Limit operates as the boundary condition that enables responsibility, differentiation, and long-term stability.

We argue that this triadic structure represents a minimal and irreducible condition for sustaining governability in hybrid human–AI systems. Removing any one of the three elements results in systemic pathologies: ungrounded interaction, coercive coherence, or brittle boundary enforcement. The triadic model thus offers a structurally integrated alternative to dyadic and modular approaches, capable of addressing the relational, normative, and operational challenges posed by contemporary hybrid systems.

## 7.2 Structural Definitions and Roles

This subsection repositions Field, Coherence, and Limit not as isolated properties, but as structural roles within a unified system.

### 7.2.1 Field as Relational Substrate

In the proposed triadic model, *Field* is understood as the relational substrate that enables the emergence, persistence, and transformation of relations within a system. It is not a background container in which interactions merely occur, but a constitutive condition that shapes what kinds of relations are possible, intelligible, and sustainable.

The field precedes discrete interactions in a structural sense. Agents—human, artificial, or institutional—do not relate in a vacuum; their interactions are always already conditioned by a shared relational environment that carries expectations, norms, affordances, and asymmetries. This environment is what we designate as the field. Without an articulated concept of field, relational dynamics are reduced to isolated exchanges, obscuring the systemic patterns through which meaning, trust, and coordination emerge.

Crucially, the field is not reducible to the sum of agents, interfaces, or data flows. While it is instantiated through these elements, it cannot be fully described by them. Data infrastructures, communication protocols, organizational charts, and algorithmic interfaces participate in shaping the field, but none exhaust its structure. The field includes informal norms, tacit expectations, power relations, temporal rhythms, and shared interpretive frames that operate across and between formal system components.

In hybrid human–AI systems, the relational field is dynamically shaped by the interaction of institutional arrangements, technological architectures, and human practices. Institutional policies and governance frameworks contribute to defining legitimate forms of action and responsibility; technological systems modulate visibility, speed, and scale of interaction; and human actors continuously adapt, resist, or reinterpret both institutional and technological constraints. The field thus evolves over time, often in ways that are only partially legible to system designers or regulators.

Understanding field as a relational substrate allows us to account for systemic phenomena that cannot be explained by agent-level behavior alone, such as loss of collective sense-making, normalization of opaque decision processes, or gradual erosion of accountability. Within the triadic structure, field provides the ground upon which coherence can emerge and within which limits acquire meaning. Without field sensitivity, attempts to engineer coherence or impose limits risk operating on an abstracted system that no longer corresponds to the lived relational reality of hybrid human–AI environments.

### 7.2.2 Coherence as a Systemic Alignment Process

In this model, coherence is defined not as a static state of equilibrium or optimization, but as a dynamic and ongoing process of alignment across multiple dimensions of a system. Rather than referring to internal consistency alone, coherence describes the capacity of a system to sustain meaningful relational integration over time while remaining responsive to contextual variation.

First, coherence is inherently temporal. Hybrid human–AI systems operate across heterogeneous timescales: human deliberation, institutional procedures, and computational processes evolve at different speeds and rhythms. Coherence emerges when these temporal layers are sufficiently aligned to allow actions, decisions, and feedback to remain mutually intelligible. Temporal incoherence—such as automated actions outpacing human oversight or institutional response—produces breakdowns in accountability and trust.

Second, coherence is functional. It requires alignment between the roles, responsibilities, and operational logics of different system components. In hybrid systems, this includes humans, technical artifacts, algorithms, interfaces, and institutional frameworks. Functional incoherence arises when optimization goals, decision criteria, or control mechanisms conflict across layers, resulting in fragmented agency or unintended systemic effects.

Third, coherence is normative. Systems are not value-neutral: they embed assumptions about responsibility, legitimacy, fairness, and acceptable risk. Normative coherence refers to the alignment between declared values, implemented rules, and actual system behavior. When normative commitments are decoupled from operational reality—such as ethical principles that lack enforcement mechanisms—coherence erodes, even if the system remains technically functional.

Across these dimensions, coherence plays a central role in sustaining intelligibility within hybrid systems. Intelligibility refers to the ability of system participants to understand how decisions are made, how actions propagate, and where responsibility resides. Without sufficient coherence, systems may continue to operate while becoming opaque, unpredictable, or socially illegible.

Finally, coherence is a precondition for trust. Trust does not emerge from performance alone, but from the perceived reliability and interpretability of relational processes over time. In hybrid human–AI systems, coherence enables trust by stabilizing expectations, clarifying agency boundaries, and maintaining continuity between intention, action, and outcome.

In this sense, coherence is not an optional optimization goal, but a structural requirement for the governability and sustainability of complex relational systems.

### 7.2.3 Limit as a Structural Boundary Condition

Within the proposed triadic model, *limit* is not understood as a mere restriction imposed on system behavior, but as a generative structural condition that enables agency, responsibility, and relational stability. Limits define the contours within which coherent interaction becomes possible, preventing both uncontrolled expansion and systemic ambiguity.

As a generative constraint, limit functions by shaping the space of possible actions rather than by prohibiting action altogether. In complex systems, the absence of well-articulated limits does not produce freedom, but rather indeterminacy, diffusion of responsibility, and loss of governability. Conversely, appropriately defined limits enable differentiation of roles, clarification of authority, and the emergence of accountable agency across system components.

Limits are therefore essential for responsibility and accountability. In hybrid human–AI systems, actions are distributed across human actors, technical systems, and institutional frameworks. Without clear boundary conditions, it becomes impossible to attribute responsibility for decisions, errors, or harms. Limits establish who can act, under what conditions, and with which forms of oversight, thereby sustaining ethical and legal intelligibility.

Furthermore, limits are necessary for agency differentiation. Human agency, institutional agency, and automated or algorithmic agency operate according to distinct logics and capacities. Treating these forms of agency as interchangeable or indistinct leads to governance failures, including over-automation, moral offloading, or unjust attribution of blame. Structural limits preserve the specificity of each form of agency while enabling coordinated interaction within the system.

A crucial distinction must be made between *explicit* and *implicit* limits. Explicit limits include formally articulated constraints such as policies, regulations, technical protocols, access controls, and procedural rules. These limits are codified, inspectable, and often enforceable through institutional mechanisms.

Implicit limits, by contrast, arise from cognitive, institutional, and ethical conditions. Cognitive limits concern human attention, comprehension, and decision-making capacity. Institutional limits emerge from organizational structures, cultural norms, and historical practices. Ethical limits reflect shared values, moral intuitions, and socially negotiated boundaries of acceptable action. Although less visible, implicit limits exert a profound influence on system behavior and often determine whether explicit limits are effective or merely symbolic.

Structural incoherence arises when explicit and implicit limits are misaligned—for example, when formal governance frameworks exceed human cognitive capacity, or when ethical expectations are not supported by institutional design. In such cases, limits may exist in name while failing to function as stabilizing boundary conditions.

In the triadic model, limit operates in continuous relation with field and coherence. Limits shape the topology of the relational field and stabilize coherence over time, while coherence ensures that limits remain intelligible and legitimate within the field. Together, these interactions position limit not as an obstacle to system performance, but as a foundational condition for sustainable, accountable, and governable hybrid systems.

## 7.3 Relational Dynamics Within the Triad

While Field, Coherence, and Limit can be analytically distinguished, their significance emerges only through their dynamic interaction. The triadic structure proposed in this paper is not static or hierarchical; it is relational and processual. Each component continuously shapes and is shaped by the others, generating systemic patterns of stability, adaptation, or breakdown. This subsection formalizes these relational dynamics by examining the three primary dyadic interactions within the triad.

### 7.3.1 Field–Coherence Interaction

The relational field conditions the forms of coherence that can emerge within a system. Because the field defines what relations are possible, intelligible, and legitimate, it sets the structural preconditions for alignment processes across system components. Coherence does not arise independently of the field; it is always coherence *within* a particular relational topology.

In fields characterized by high relational density—where interactions are frequent, mediated across multiple layers, and institutionally entangled—coherence requires continuous negotiation and recalibration. Alignment in such contexts is inherently fragile: small shifts in norms, interfaces, or power asymmetries can propagate widely, producing systemic effects that exceed localized interactions. Conversely, sparse or weakly articulated fields may fail to sustain coherence altogether, as participants lack shared reference frames necessary for mutual intelligibility.

The interaction between field and coherence is mediated through feedback loops. As coherence stabilizes expectations and interpretive frames, it reinforces the structure of the field, making certain relations more durable and others less salient. At the same time, changes in the field—such as the introduction of new AI-mediated decision systems, institutional reforms, or shifts in participation—can destabilize existing coherence patterns. In this sense, coherence both depends on and actively reshapes the field.

Importantly, attempts to engineer coherence without attending to the relational field often result in superficial or brittle alignment. For example, algorithmic standardization may produce apparent consistency in outputs while masking deep incoherence at the level of meaning, responsibility, or trust. Field–coherence sensitivity is therefore essential for distinguishing between genuine systemic alignment and merely formal or enforced coherence.

### 7.3.2 Coherence–Limit Interaction

Limits play a critical role in stabilizing coherence by preventing alignment processes from collapsing into rigidity or overreach. Coherence, left unchecked, can become self-reinforcing to the point of suppressing plurality, adaptability, and critical contestation. In such cases, coherence shifts from a relational integrative process to a mechanism of control.

Well-articulated limits function as stabilizers that preserve the openness of coherence. By defining boundaries of authority, scope of action, and conditions of override or exception, limits ensure that coherence remains responsive rather than totalizing. They enable systems to maintain alignment while accommodating diversity of perspectives, contextual variation, and ethical dissent.

At the same time, insufficient or poorly defined limits undermine coherence. Under-limitation leads to fragmentation, as alignment processes lack anchoring conditions for responsibility and decision-making. In hybrid human–AI systems, this often manifests as diffusion of agency: automated processes operate without clear oversight, while human actors are unable to intervene meaningfully due to opacity or scale.

The coherence–limit interaction thus involves a continuous balancing act. Over-coherence produces rigidity, path dependence, and suppression of alternative interpretations; under-limitation produces instability, ambiguity, and loss of governability. Sustainable systems require limits that are neither merely restrictive nor purely symbolic, but structurally integrated into coherence processes themselves.

### 7.3.3 Field–Limit Interaction

Limits are not imposed on a neutral substrate; they are enacted within the relational field and, in doing so, actively reshape it. Boundary-setting is therefore a relational act rather than a purely technical or legal intervention. The effectiveness of limits depends on how they are interpreted, internalized, and negotiated within the field.

When limits are well-aligned with the relational field, they clarify expectations, reinforce legitimate authority, and enhance trust. For instance, transparent institutional limits on automated decision-making can stabilize human–AI relations by making the scope and consequences of algorithmic action intelligible to affected participants. In such cases, limits contribute to field legibility and relational predictability.

Conversely, limits that are misaligned with the field may either fail to function or generate unintended consequences. Formal constraints that ignore informal practices, power dynamics, or cognitive realities may be circumvented, ignored, or selectively enforced. This can lead to the emergence of shadow practices that further destabilize the field, eroding both coherence and accountability.

Institutional limits are particularly significant as field-shaping mechanisms. Policies, regulations, and governance frameworks do not merely constrain behavior; they signal normative priorities and redistribute relational power. In hybrid systems, institutional limits determine how AI systems are positioned within the field—whether as tools, agents, advisors, or authorities—and thereby shape the entire relational topology.

Within the triadic structure, the field–limit interaction ensures that boundaries remain meaningful rather than abstract. Limits acquire legitimacy only insofar as they resonate with the lived relational conditions of the system. At the same time, the articulation of limits can transform the field by redefining roles, responsibilities, and modes of participation. This mutual shaping underscores why limits cannot be treated as external constraints, but must be understood as integral components of relational system design.

## 7.4 Conditions of Stability and Rupture

The analysis of dyadic interactions in the previous subsection demonstrates that Field, Coherence, and Limit operate through continuous and mutually constitutive dynamics. However, the mere presence of these interactions does not, by itself, ensure the long-term sustainability of the system. This subsection therefore shifts the analytical focus from relational dynamics to the **structural conditions** under which those dynamics remain stable—or, alternatively, give rise to systemic rupture.

This subsection identifies the conditions under which the triadic structure sustains or collapses.

### 7.4.1 Conditions for Structural Stability

The stability of the triadic structure depends on a set of necessary—though not sufficient—conditions that allow Field, Coherence, and Limit to remain mutually reinforcing over time. Structural stability does not imply stasis or the absence of conflict; rather, it refers to the system’s capacity to absorb variation, contestation, and change without losing governability or relational intelligibility. Three interdependent conditions are particularly critical: minimum thresholds of coherence, adequate articulation of limits, and transparency and legibility of the relational field.

**Minimum thresholds of coherence.**
For a system to remain governable, coherence must exceed a minimum threshold across temporal, functional, and normative dimensions. Below this threshold, components may continue to operate locally, yet the system as a whole becomes unintelligible and non-accountable.

Minimum coherence does not require total alignment or full consensus. Instead, it requires sufficient integration for participants to: (a) understand how actions propagate across layers, (b) anticipate the consequences of interventions, and (c) locate responsibility for decisions and outcomes. When this threshold is not met, opaque decision chains, conflicting operational logics, and erosion of trust tend to emerge—even in systems that remain technically functional.

These thresholds are context-dependent. High-impact domains such as healthcare, public administration, or judicial systems demand higher levels of coherence than exploratory or low-risk settings. Structural stability therefore does not require maximal coherence, but coherence calibrated to the social, ethical, and institutional conditions of the environment in which the system operates.

**Adequate articulation of limits.**
Structural stability also depends on the presence of limits that are clearly articulated, operationally enforceable, and intelligible within the relational field. Limits must consistently define scopes of authority, conditions of action, and mechanisms of accountability across human, institutional, and technical components.

Poorly articulated limits—whether due to excessive vagueness, unnecessary complexity, or misalignment with actual practices—fail to function as stabilizing conditions. Such failures typically produce two recurrent effects: erosion of limits, when boundaries exist only formally, or normative hypertrophy, when constraints accumulate without real integration into system processes.

Adequate articulation requires coherence between explicit and implicit limits. Formal rules, institutional policies, and technical constraints must remain compatible with human cognitive capacities, organizational routines, and shared ethical expectations. When this compatibility is absent, limits become symbolic or performative, weakening both coherence and legitimacy. Stability thus arises not from the mere existence of limits, but from their structural integration into relational processes.

**Transparency and legibility of the field.**
The third condition of stability concerns the degree of transparency and legibility of the relational field itself. Field transparency refers to the visibility of relational structures—roles, dependencies, decision trajectories, and power asymmetries. Legibility, in turn, refers to participants’ capacity to interpret these structures and orient their actions accordingly.

Opaque or weakly legible fields compromise stability even when coherence and limits are formally present. Actors may comply with rules or interact with systems without understanding how outcomes are produced or how responsibility is distributed. In such environments, trust becomes fragile, contestation is distorted, and corrective mechanisms fail to operate effectively.

In hybrid socio-technical systems, field opacity is often amplified by algorithmic mediation, scale, and speed. Causal chains become difficult to trace, while institutional overlap diffuses accountability. Structural stability therefore requires deliberate efforts to render the field sufficiently legible—through transparency practices, interpretability measures, participatory governance, and reflexive oversight.

It is important to note that field transparency does not imply total visibility or unrestricted disclosure. Rather, it requires that the relational structure be intelligible enough to sustain informed participation, meaningful supervision, and responsible intervention. Excessive opacity destabilizes the triadic structure by decoupling coherence from lived relational experience and rendering limits abstract or inoperable.

Taken together, these three conditions delineate the minimum structural requirements for sustaining the triadic model. When coherence thresholds are met, limits are adequately articulated, and the field remains transparent and legible, such systems retain their capacity for adaptive governance. When one or more of these conditions fail, the system becomes vulnerable to the modes of rupture examined in the following subsection.

### 7.4.2 Modes of Rupture

When the structural conditions outlined above are not met, the triadic structure becomes vulnerable to distinct but interrelated modes of rupture. These ruptures do not necessarily manifest as immediate system failure; rather, they often emerge gradually, through erosion of relational intelligibility, accountability, or adaptive capacity. This subsection analyzes three primary modes of rupture—field collapse, coherence breakdown, and limit erosion or overextension—focusing on their systemic consequences for governance and decision-making in hybrid human–AI systems.

**Field collapse (loss of shared relational ground).**
Field collapse occurs when the relational substrate that enables shared meaning, expectation, and coordination disintegrates. In such conditions, system participants no longer operate within a common relational environment, even if formal structures and interactions persist. The loss of shared relational ground undermines collective sense-making and renders coordination increasingly fragile.

In hybrid systems, field collapse often results from cumulative opacity, asymmetrical power redistribution, or rapid technological mediation that outpaces institutional and cultural adaptation. Algorithmic systems may reconfigure relational dynamics—such as authority, visibility, or participation—without corresponding updates to shared interpretive frames. Over time, participants lose the ability to situate actions within a coherent relational context.

The governance consequences of field collapse are severe. Decision-making becomes fragmented, as actors interpret system behavior through incompatible or incomplete frames of reference. Trust deteriorates, not necessarily due to malice or error, but because the system no longer provides a stable ground for mutual intelligibility. In such environments, formal governance mechanisms may remain in place while losing practical effectiveness, as they no longer resonate with the lived relational reality of the system.

**Coherence breakdown (misalignment across system layers).**
Coherence breakdown arises when alignment across temporal, functional, or normative dimensions deteriorates below a viable threshold. Unlike field collapse, which concerns the erosion of the relational substrate itself, coherence breakdown involves misalignment among system components that continue to share a field but fail to operate intelligibly together.

In hybrid human–AI systems, coherence breakdown frequently manifests as temporal misalignment—automated processes operating at speeds incompatible with human oversight or institutional response—or as functional misalignment, where optimization criteria embedded in AI systems conflict with organizational goals or ethical commitments. Normative misalignment is particularly destabilizing, as it decouples declared values from operational practice.

The systemic consequences include opaque decision chains, contradictory outcomes, and diffusion of responsibility. Governance mechanisms struggle to intervene effectively because breakdowns occur not at a single point of failure, but across interacting layers. Systems may appear operationally successful while becoming socially illegible and normatively incoherent. Over time, this condition erodes legitimacy and undermines the capacity for corrective action.

**Limit erosion or overextension.**
The third mode of rupture concerns failures in the articulation and functioning of limits. Limit erosion occurs when boundaries that once structured responsibility and authority gradually lose force—through normalization of exceptions, automation without oversight, or institutional fatigue. Overextension, by contrast, arises when limits proliferate excessively or rigidly, constraining system adaptability and suppressing legitimate variation.

In hybrid systems, limit erosion often takes the form of unexamined delegation to automated processes. As AI systems become embedded in decision-making, human and institutional actors may defer responsibility, assuming that technical constraints suffice as governance mechanisms. This erodes accountability and obscures the conditions under which intervention is possible or required.

Limit overextension produces a different but equally destabilizing effect. Excessive regulation, rigid proceduralization, or over-specification of constraints can inhibit learning, adaptation, and contextual judgment. In such cases, actors may engage in performative compliance, adhering to formal limits while circumventing their spirit in practice. Both erosion and overextension decouple limits from the relational field, rendering them ineffective as stabilizing boundary conditions.

Across all three modes of rupture, a common pattern emerges: governance failure is not primarily the result of isolated errors, but of structural misalignment within the triadic system. Field collapse undermines shared meaning, coherence breakdown disrupts intelligibility across layers, and limit failures dissolve responsibility and accountability. These ruptures reinforce one another, often producing cascading effects that are difficult to reverse once entrenched.

Understanding these modes of rupture is therefore essential for diagnosing systemic fragility in hybrid human–AI systems. Rather than focusing solely on technical performance or rule compliance, governance frameworks must attend to the relational integrity of the triadic structure itself. Only by doing so can systems remain resilient, intelligible, and ethically governable over time.

## 7.5 Implications for Hybrid Human–AI Systems

This subsection bridges the abstract structure to the domain of hybrid systems.

* How AI systems participate in and reshape the relational field
* Risks of coherence enforced through automation without field sensitivity
* Limits as essential safeguards against unaccountable systemic agency

### 7.5.1 AI Participation in the Relational Field

Such hybrid socio-technical systems are characterized not only by the presence of algorithmic agents but also by their active participation in shaping the relational substrate of the system. Within the triadic model, AI does not operate in a vacuum; its interventions unfold within a pre-existing **Field** and simultaneously contribute to the dynamic evolution of that Field. Understanding the mechanisms, dynamics, and feedback effects of AI participation is therefore essential for anticipating systemic consequences and designing resilient governance structures.

**Mechanisms of AI interaction within the Field.**
AI algorithms function as both **mediators and relational agents**. As mediators, they influence patterns of interaction among human actors by filtering information, amplifying or suppressing communication channels, and prioritizing specific decision pathways. As relational agents, AI systems introduce their own outputs into the Field, establishing dependencies, expectations, and potential points of coordination or tension with human and institutional actors.

AI participation directly affects the **visibility of actions, temporal rhythm, and informational flows** within these environments. Automated recommendations or predictive systems may accelerate decision-making beyond human temporal capacities, while AI-generated summaries or alerts may selectively foreground certain relations, reshaping attention and interpretive focus. In each case, the Field itself is modified by the presence and behavior of algorithmic agents.

**Dynamic reconfiguration of the Field.**
AI interventions can **alter relational density**—the number, frequency, and interconnectedness of interactions—as well as the **distribution of tacit expectations** among participants. In high-density AI-mediated contexts, coordination may be amplified through shared informational substrates, yet such density can also generate congestion, attention overload, or subtle power asymmetries. Algorithmic systems may inadvertently privilege particular pathways or actors, reinforcing existing hierarchies or giving rise to novel relational patterns not anticipated in institutional design.

The implications of Field reconfiguration extend to **trust, shared meaning, and coordination**. When AI outputs are consistent, interpretable, and aligned with institutional norms, expectations may stabilize and collective intelligibility may be reinforced. Conversely, opaque or unpredictable algorithmic behavior can erode trust and shared sense-making, introducing latent fragility even where technical performance remains high.

**Feedback loops and systemic effects.**
The relationship between AI and the Field is inherently recursive. **Changes induced by AI feed back into both Coherence and Limit**, reshaping alignment processes and altering how boundaries are interpreted and enacted. Algorithmically mediated coordination may, for example, strengthen functional coherence by synchronizing actions across layers, while simultaneously challenging normative coherence if outputs conflict with ethical commitments or human expectations. Likewise, Field responses to AI interventions may necessitate the recalibration of explicit and implicit limits to preserve intelligibility and accountability.

These **feedback loops** may generate either **reinforcing stability or emergent instability**. Stability arises when AI contributions harmonize with human and institutional processes, supporting the mutual reinforcement of the triadic elements. Instability emerges when algorithmic interventions disrupt relational patterns, overload coherence mechanisms, or strain existing limits—potentially precipitating the modes of rupture outlined in Section 7.4.2. Attending to these dynamics is therefore critical for the design of systems that remain adaptive, intelligible, and ethically accountable over time.

### 7.5.2 Risks of Coherence Enforced Through Automation

While algorithmic systems can facilitate alignment and reduce operational friction, **overreliance on automated coherence** introduces systemic risks when the relational Field is insufficiently considered. Coherence enforced through automation—though appearing effective at a technical level—can generate vulnerabilities in intelligibility, accountability, and adaptability if the structural dynamics of the triad are neglected.

**Overreliance on algorithmic alignment.**
Automated processes may impose apparent coherence by optimizing decision outputs, synchronizing actions across layers, or enforcing procedural consistency. However, without sensitivity to the Field, such interventions risk **producing coherence that is decoupled from relational reality**. Participants may experience the system as internally aligned, yet underlying social, cognitive, or institutional structures remain partially disconnected. This misalignment can undermine trust, reduce interpretability, and obscure the conditions under which human or institutional intervention remains possible.

**Risks of rigidity and suppression of plurality.**
Mechanically imposed coherence may **constrain the diversity of perspectives, approaches, or interpretations** within these environments. Uniform algorithmic decision-making can inadvertently reinforce path dependence, reducing flexibility and adaptive capacity. In complex socio-technical settings, this rigidity limits responsiveness to unforeseen events, novel information, or ethical dilemmas—thereby amplifying the likelihood of latent systemic failure.

**Disconnection between normativity and operationality.**
Automated coherence frequently privileges functional or procedural alignment while neglecting normative dimensions embedded in the Field. When AI-driven actions conflict with declared institutional values, ethical commitments, or social expectations, **normative coherence erodes**. Actors may comply technically with algorithmic outputs while perceiving them as misaligned with institutional purpose or moral legitimacy. This disjunction destabilizes trust and weakens the perceived legitimacy of governance mechanisms.

**Cascading governance effects.**
Failures in field-sensitive alignment propagate across the triadic structure, affecting both Limits and overall coherence. Automated systems that generate consistent yet opaque outputs may inadvertently **diffuse responsibility** among human and institutional actors. Uncritical reliance on algorithmic decisions can initiate feedback loops that amplify latent fragility, producing cascading governance effects that are difficult to detect and correct. This demonstrates that the **mechanical enforcement of coherence**, absent relational sensitivity, can paradoxically undermine both intelligibility and systemic stability.

In sum, while automation can support alignment, these risks underscore the necessity of integrating **Field awareness and Limit calibration** into the design, deployment, and monitoring of hybrid human–AI arrangements. Sustaining adaptive, intelligible, and accountable coherence requires more than algorithmic efficiency—it demands continuous attention to the relational and normative conditions in which such systems operate.

### 7.5.3 Limits as Essential Safeguards

Within hybrid socio-technical environments, Limits function as foundational mechanisms for maintaining intelligibility, accountability, and adaptive capacity. While AI participation and automated coherence can enhance efficiency, without clearly articulated boundaries these mechanisms risk generating structural fragility. Limits operate not as mere constraints, but as **structural safeguards** that preserve the integrity of the triadic system.

**Preservation of differentiated agency.**
Explicit and implicit limits delineate the roles and responsibilities of **human actors, institutions, and algorithmic agents**. By sustaining clear differentiation of agency, limits prevent over-automation, inappropriate delegation of decision authority, and conflation of responsibilities. This structural clarity ensures that each form of agency operates within its domain of competence, enabling coordinated and accountable action within the relational Field.

**Accountability and distributed responsibility.**
Limits serve as mechanisms for supervision, escalation, and intervention, allowing responsibility to be attributed in an intelligible manner. Explicit limits—such as policies, technical protocols, and procedural rules—provide inspectable frameworks for governance. Implicit limits, arising from cognitive, institutional, and ethical constraints, complement these formal structures by shaping how authority is interpreted and exercised in practice. Together, these boundaries ensure that accountability remains **distributed yet legible**, mitigating the risk of responsibility diffusion in complex socio-technical contexts.

**Prevention of systemic ruptures.**
Well-calibrated limits play a critical role in mitigating **Field collapse** and **Coherence breakdown**, the primary modes of structural rupture identified in Section 7.4.2. By defining permissible actions, scopes of authority, and pathways for intervention or review, limits stabilize relational dynamics and support intelligible alignment. Adequately articulated boundaries prevent excessive rigidity while avoiding under-limitation, sustaining both adaptability and systemic resilience.

**Integration of limits into hybrid system design.**
Effective limits are embedded directly into system architecture, governance processes, and operational workflows. Examples include:

* Policy frameworks specifying conditions under which automated decision-making is permitted
* Technical protocols defining thresholds for human intervention or override
* Monitoring and alert mechanisms that signal boundary violations or anomalous behavior
* Participatory governance arrangements that involve stakeholders in reviewing and recalibrating limits

Embedding limits into the design of these systems ensures that human and AI agents operate **within a relationally intelligible and normatively coherent framework**, preserving both stability and accountability. Limits are not obstacles to automation or alignment; they are **enablers of sustainable governance**, ensuring that Field and Coherence remain legible, adaptable, and structurally integrated over time.

### 7.5.4 Integrative Observations

The previous subsections have examined the participation of AI in the relational Field, the risks associated with automated coherence, and the stabilizing function of Limits. This final subsection synthesizes these insights to highlight the **interdependence of Field, Coherence, and Limit in practice** and to outline **general principles for hybrid governance**.

**Field–Coherence–Limit interdependence in practice.**
Hybrid systems illustrate that the triadic elements are mutually reinforcing. AI can **strengthen the triad** when its outputs enhance intelligibility, stabilize alignment, and respect established boundaries. Conversely, AI interventions can **weaken the triad** when automation prioritizes efficiency over relational legibility, bypasses limits, or produces misalignment across temporal, functional, or normative layers. In practice, these effects are not isolated; changes in one component propagate through the others via feedback loops, emphasizing the systemic nature of relational coherence.

**General guidance for hybrid governance.**
Effective management of hybrid human–AI systems requires continuous attention to the triadic structure:

* **Continuous monitoring of the Field:** Ensure that relational patterns, power asymmetries, and interpretive frames remain intelligible to all relevant actors. Transparency and visibility mechanisms should be employed to maintain shared understanding.

* **Periodic evaluation of automated coherence:** Automated alignment should be assessed not only for efficiency but also for functional and normative compatibility. Misalignments must be detected and corrected before they destabilize system-wide intelligibility.

* **Adaptive review and calibration of Limits:** Limits should be revisited and adjusted in response to changes in the Field or Coherence. Both explicit and implicit boundaries must evolve to preserve differentiated agency, accountability, and system stability.

By applying these principles, governance mechanisms can **leverage AI’s capabilities** while safeguarding against the systemic risks identified in Section 7.4.2. The triadic model thus provides a conceptual and operational framework for designing, monitoring, and adapting hybrid human–AI systems in ways that sustain intelligibility, trust, and accountability over time.

## 7.6 Summary and Transition to Governance Implications

This chapter has presented a **triadic model of relational coherence**, integrating **Field, Coherence, and Limit** as mutually constitutive structural conditions essential for the governability of hybrid human–AI systems. Each component plays a distinct but interdependent role: the Field provides the relational substrate for meaningful interactions; Coherence sustains temporal, functional, and normative alignment; and Limits establish boundaries that enable accountability, agency differentiation, and systemic stability.

The analysis demonstrates that the triadic structure is **both minimal and irreducible**. Removing or weakening any one element produces systemic pathologies: ungrounded interaction when the Field is neglected, coercive or brittle alignment when Limits are absent, and opaque or misaligned processes when Coherence thresholds are insufficient. Furthermore, the dynamic interactions among the three components generate feedback loops that reinforce stability or precipitate gradual systemic rupture, as evidenced in the conditions and modes of instability described in Section 7.4.

The triadic model is **directly relevant for governance and institutional design**. By conceptualizing AI systems as participants within a relational Field and by acknowledging the structural necessity of Coherence and Limits, policymakers and institutional designers can anticipate risks of over-automation, misalignment, and opacity. The model provides a framework for **designing adaptive governance mechanisms**, ensuring that hybrid systems remain intelligible, accountable, and resilient over time.

In preparation for Section 8, the triadic framework serves as a **conceptual bridge between structural analysis and applied governance**. It informs the development of practical guidelines, institutional safeguards, and policy interventions aimed at sustaining relational coherence in socio-technical environments characterized by the integration of human and AI agents. The next chapter will extend this theoretical foundation to explore **specific governance strategies, oversight mechanisms, and policy implications**, illustrating how the triadic model can guide the design and evaluation of accountable, adaptive, and ethically aligned hybrid systems.

## 7.6 Minimalidade da Estrutura Triádica

A estrutura triádica proposta — **Campo, Coerência e Limite** — pretende ser não apenas integrada, mas **mínima**. Afirmar minimalidade implica sustentar que nenhum elemento adicional é estruturalmente necessário para explicar as condições de possibilidade da governabilidade em sistemas híbridos humano–IA.

A minimalidade aqui reivindicada não é empírica, mas estrutural. Ela se refere às condições fundamentais sem as quais governabilidade deixa de ser inteligível como tal.

Qualquer sistema governável deve necessariamente satisfazer três tipos de condição:

1. **Condição espacial-relacional** — deve existir um espaço estruturado no qual agentes, regras e interações se tornem possíveis e inteligíveis. Essa condição corresponde ao **Campo**.
2. **Condição dinâmica-temporal** — as interações que ocorrem nesse espaço devem manter compatibilidade suficiente ao longo do tempo para evitar fragmentação, contradição estrutural ou perda de inteligibilidade. Essa condição corresponde à **Coerência**.
3. **Condição de fronteira-diferenciação** — deve haver delimitações que preservem a diferenciabilidade da agência, a atribuibilidade de responsabilidade e a possibilidade de intervenção. Essa condição corresponde ao **Limite**.

Se qualquer uma dessas condições estiver ausente, o que permanece pode ser coordenação técnica, controle funcional ou conformidade formal — mas não governabilidade.

A alegação de minimalidade pode ser examinada por meio da tentativa de introduzir um quarto elemento estrutural. Conceitos frequentemente invocados na literatura de governança — como transparência, confiança, poder, participação, supervisão ou accountability — podem ser reconduzidos a um ou mais componentes da tríade.

- **Transparência** refere-se à legibilidade do Campo e à rastreabilidade sustentada pela Coerência.
- **Confiança** emerge da Coerência ao longo do tempo, dentro de limites estáveis.
- **Poder** opera como propriedade estrutural do Campo e é delimitado por Limites.
- **Accountability** depende da diferenciabilidade garantida pelos Limites e da inteligibilidade sustentada pela Coerência.
- **Supervisão** constitui mecanismo institucional de Limite operando em um Campo inteligível.

Nenhum desses elementos introduz uma nova categoria estrutural; todos dependem das três condições fundamentais já identificadas.

A estrutura triádica é, portanto, mínima no sentido de que abrange as condições espaciais, dinâmicas e de fronteira necessárias para a governabilidade. Não se trata de um modelo exaustivo de todos os fenômenos relevantes, mas de uma articulação das **condições estruturais sem as quais governabilidade não pode ser sustentada**.

Assim compreendida, a tríade não compete com frameworks adicionais, mas fornece o plano estrutural dentro do qual tais frameworks podem ser situados, avaliados ou integrados.

## 7.7

Tendo estabelecido a tríade como condição estrutural mínima da governabilidade, a seção seguinte traduz essa arquitetura em implicações diagnósticas e normativas para o desenho e supervisão de sistemas híbridos humano–IA.
