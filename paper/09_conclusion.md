## Governability as a Structural Achievement

This article has advanced a structural claim: governability in hybrid human–AI systems depends on the sustained integrity of three irreducible conditions — **Field, Coherence, and Limit**.

Rather than treating governance as a matter of rule enforcement, output optimization, or institutional compliance alone, the analysis reframed governability as a relational achievement. Systems remain governable only insofar as their relational substrate remains intelligible (Field), their cross-layer interactions remain compatible over time (Coherence), and their boundaries preserve differentiated agency and accountability (Limit).

The argument has been both analytical and architectural.

Analytically, it demonstrated that contemporary governance challenges in hybrid systems cannot be adequately explained by diadic models focused on alignment, control, or boundary-setting in isolation. Failures of governability emerge not merely from technical malfunction or regulatory gaps, but from structural degradation within the triadic architecture itself.

Architecturally, it translated these structural conditions into governance requirements: relational visibility, layered coherence assessment, dynamic boundary calibration, and diagnostic monitoring of rupture modes. In doing so, the triadic model was positioned not only as a theoretical lens, but as an institutional design framework.

The claim of this work is minimal yet decisive.

Any system that aspires to be governable must satisfy three structural conditions:

- A relational space within which agency and authority are intelligible;
- A degree of sustained compatibility across temporal, functional, and normative layers;
- Boundaries that preserve differentiated agency and make responsibility attributable.

If any of these conditions collapse, what remains may be coordination, compliance, or control — but not governability in the full institutional sense.

The triadic model is therefore minimal, not maximal. It does not exhaust the phenomena of governance. It does not replace domain-specific regulation, ethical theory, or institutional design traditions. Instead, it identifies the structural architecture within which such efforts must operate if they are to remain meaningful under conditions of hybrid human–AI integration.

As sociotechnical systems grow in scale, autonomy, and institutional embedding, pressures toward opacity, automation, and authority diffusion will intensify. The risk is not merely error, but the gradual erosion of differentiated agency and relational intelligibility. Under such conditions, governance may persist formally while hollowing out structurally.

The contribution of this article is to make that erosion conceptually visible.

Governability in hybrid systems cannot be presumed. It must be maintained as a structural achievement — through the continuous stewardship of Field integrity, Coherence compatibility, and Limit differentiation.

Where these three conditions are jointly sustained, adaptive governance remains possible.

Where any one of them is neglected, fragility accumulates — often silently.

The future of hybrid human–AI systems will not be determined solely by technical capability, but by whether institutions can preserve the structural conditions that make responsibility, accountability, and correction possible.

The triadic framework offered here provides a minimal architecture for that task.
