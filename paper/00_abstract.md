# 00 — Abstract

Hybrid human–AI systems are increasingly embedded within institutional decision-making, yet prevailing governance frameworks remain fragmented, oscillating between technical alignment, regulatory compliance, and boundary-setting approaches. This article advances a structural claim: governability in hybrid systems depends on the sustained integrity of three irreducible conditions — **Field, Coherence, and Limit**.

Field designates the relational space within which agency and authority become intelligible. Coherence refers to the sustained compatibility of temporal, functional, and normative interactions across system layers. Limit establishes differentiated boundaries of agency, preserving accountability and the possibility of intervention. Together, these elements form a minimal triadic architecture of governability.

The article argues that existing diadic or modular models fail to capture the structural interdependence of these conditions. When any one of the three degrades, systems may continue to function technically or comply formally, yet governability erodes. The triadic model is therefore presented as a minimal structural condition for institutional governance under conditions of hybrid agency.

Beyond conceptual clarification, the framework is translated into governance requirements, including relational visibility, layered coherence assessment, dynamic boundary calibration, and structural diagnostics of rupture modes. By integrating structural theory with institutional design implications, the article offers both a foundational lens for analyzing hybrid systems and a practical architecture for sustaining adaptive governance.

Governability, on this account, is not a property guaranteed by performance or control, but a structural achievement sustained through the intelligibility of relations, the compatibility of interactions, and the differentiation of agency.
