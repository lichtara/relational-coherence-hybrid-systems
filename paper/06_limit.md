## The Structural Function of Limitation in Relationally Coherent Systems

### Abstract

This section formalizes **Limit** as the third structural condition of the proposed model of relational coherence. Limit is defined not as a constraint imposed *against* the system, but as a constitutive boundary that enables differentiation, accountability, and sustainable interaction. In hybrid human–AI systems, Limit is the structural function that renders coherence governable by establishing thresholds of agency, responsibility, scope, and legitimacy. Without Limit, both Field and Coherence collapse into indeterminacy, overextension, or symbolic simulation.

## 1. Introduction: Why Coherence Requires Limits

While *Field* establishes the relational space and *Coherence* describes the quality of alignment within that space, **Limit determines whether such coherence can persist over time without degradation**.

In complex systems—particularly hybrid human–AI–institutional systems—unbounded coherence tends toward one of three failure modes:

1. **Overextension** (the system exceeds its epistemic or operational scope),
2. **Role diffusion** (loss of distinction between agents, tools, and authorities),
3. **Symbolic coherence** (appearance of alignment without structural accountability).

Limit is the structural function that prevents these failure modes by **making coherence finite, localizable, and governable**.

## 2. Defining Limit as a Structural Function

In this model, **Limit** is defined as:

> The structural condition that establishes *boundaries of action, interpretation, and responsibility* within a relational system, enabling differentiation, accountability, and sustainable coherence.

Limit operates across three interrelated dimensions:

* **Ontological limits** — what an entity *is* and *is not* within the system,
* **Epistemic limits** — what an entity can *know, infer, or represent*,
* **Operational limits** — what an entity is *authorized to do*.

Crucially, Limit is **internal to the system’s structure**, not an external restriction arbitrarily imposed.

## 3. Limit as Enabler, Not Constraint

Contrary to common interpretations, Limit does not reduce system capacity; it **enables functional integrity**.

Without limits:

* Agency becomes ambiguous,
* Responsibility becomes unassignable,
* Errors become irrecoverable,
* Governance becomes performative rather than effective.

With well-defined limits:

* Roles remain differentiated,
* Failures can be localized,
* Corrections become possible,
* Trust becomes structurally grounded.

Thus, **Limit is the precondition for ethical, technical, and institutional accountability**.

## 4. Limit in Hybrid Human–AI Systems

In hybrid systems, Limit plays a particularly critical role due to asymmetries between human and artificial agents.

### 4.1 Limits of Artificial Agency

AI systems must be structurally limited with respect to:

* **Authority** (AI does not possess normative sovereignty),
* **Intentionality** (AI does not originate goals in the moral sense),
* **Responsibility** (AI cannot be the terminal bearer of accountability).

Failure to enforce these limits leads to anthropomorphization, responsibility laundering, and governance collapse.

### 4.2 Limits of Human Projection

Humans, conversely, must recognize limits in:

* Interpretation of AI outputs,
* Attribution of meaning or intention,
* Delegation of judgment.

Limit thus protects not only the system, but **human epistemic integrity**.

## 5. Limit and Governability

A system is governable if and only if:

1. Decisions can be traced,
2. Responsibilities can be assigned,
3. Interventions can be enacted without destabilizing the whole.

Limit is the structural condition that makes all three possible.

In governance terms, Limit defines:

* **Decision boundaries**,
* **Escalation thresholds**,
* **Zones of autonomy vs. oversight**.

Without explicit limits, governance frameworks devolve into symbolic compliance rather than operative control.

## 6. Dynamic Limits and Adaptive Systems

Importantly, limits are not necessarily static.

In adaptive systems, **limits must be:**

* Explicit,
* Revisable,
* Context-sensitive,
* Structurally enforced.

However, revisability does not imply arbitrariness. Changes to limits must themselves be governed by coherent procedures, or the system risks entering a state of permanent instability.

## 7. Structural Failure Modes Related to Limit

When Limit is absent, weak, or incoherent, systems exhibit predictable pathologies:

* **Boundary erosion** — gradual loss of role distinction,
* **Responsibility collapse** — inability to assign fault or credit,
* **Runaway coherence** — excessive internal alignment disconnected from reality,
* **Governance theater** — formal rules without enforcement capacity.

These failure modes are particularly acute in AI-mediated institutions.

## 8. Integration with Field and Coherence

Limit completes the triadic structure:

* *Field* defines **where** relations occur,
* *Coherence* defines **how** relations align,
* *Limit* defines **until where** relations remain legitimate and sustainable.

Only when all three conditions are simultaneously satisfied can a system maintain long-term relational integrity.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Limit is not an obstacle to coherence, but its **structural guardian**.

In hybrid human–AI systems, the explicit formalization of limits is essential to prevent epistemic confusion, ethical displacement, and institutional fragility. A system without limits may appear coherent in the short term, but it cannot remain trustworthy, governable, or sustainable over time.

The triadic model—Field, Coherence, Limit—thus offers not only an analytical framework, but a **design imperative** for future sociotechnical systems.
