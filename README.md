# Toward a Structural Model of Relational Coherence for Hybrid Human–AI Systems

This repository contains the working materials for an academic paper proposing a **structural model of relational coherence** applicable to **hybrid human–AI–institutional systems**.

The work addresses the growing gap between the expansion of socio-technical systems involving artificial intelligence and the absence of formal models capable of ensuring **systemic governability, coherence, and sustainability** across human, technical, and institutional layers.

## Core Contribution

The paper introduces a **triadic structural model** composed of three interdependent constructs:

* **Field** — the relational configuration in which interactions, constraints, and influences emerge.
* **Coherence** — the degree of structural compatibility and mutual intelligibility among agents, processes, and institutions within a field.
* **Limit** — the operational, cognitive, and institutional boundaries that enable stability, accountability, and adaptive regulation.

Together, these constructs are proposed as **necessary conditions for governable and sustainable hybrid systems**.

## Research Scope

The contribution is **theoretical and conceptual**, aiming to provide a foundational model that can be applied to:

* AI governance and institutional design
* Socio-technical systems
* Hybrid human–AI decision-making environments
* Complex adaptive systems involving algorithmic mediation

The model is not presented as a normative framework, but as an **ontological and structural lens** for analysis, diagnosis, and design.

## Status

Work in progress — **conceptual paper (theoretical contribution)**.

## Related and Planned Outputs

* **White paper** applying the model to real-world platforms and institutions
* **Governance-oriented protocols** derived from the structural model
* **Ontological formalization** of Field, Coherence, and Limit
